                Our technical support team is here to provide help, should you run
                into issues. You wonâ€™t have to talk to computers or navigate voice
                menus, but have actual human beings answering you personally.
                <br />
                <br />
                This support is already included in your subscription fee, so
                there are no further costs for you. If you have issues with your
                Kolab Now account, or questions about our product before you sign
                up, please contact us.
